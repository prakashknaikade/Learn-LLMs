# Learn LLMs

This repo is result of getting a hands-on experience of using different LLM models and tools. I am going to use a lot of tools and practice with small projects that will grow as I apply the new knowledge acquired.
This repo is going to be a basic implementation of different LLMs to understand the finetuning, data preparation, evaluation & other techniques related to LLMs.
